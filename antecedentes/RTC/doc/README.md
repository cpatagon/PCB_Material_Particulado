# Modulo RTC

This RTC module circuit has few external components like 32.768 KHz quartz crystal element, filter capacitor 0.1uF and pullups resisters 4.7KΩ, this RTC provides I²C address about 0x68. This little breakout that uses the DS1307 to keep track of the current year, month, day as well as the current time. The module comes fully assembled and includes a small CR1225 Lithium coin cell battery that will run the RTC for a minimum of 9 years (17 years typical) without an external 5V power supply
